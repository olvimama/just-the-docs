Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out?

We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling.

For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files.

If you want to add a scheme named foo (can be any name) just add a file _sass/color_schemes/foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Since the default color scheme is light, your custom scheme is implicitly based on the variable settings used by the light scheme. If you want your custom scheme to be based on the dark scheme, you need to start your file with the following line: . @import \"./color_schemes/dark\"; . You can define custom schemes based on other custom schemes in the same way. Available variables are listed in the _variables.scss file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: . Example . $link-color: $blue-000; . Keep in mind that changing a variable will not automatically change the value of other variables that depend on it. For example, the default link color ($link-color) is set to $purple-000. However, redefining $purple-000 in a custom color scheme will not automatically change $link-color to match it. Instead, each variable that relies on previously-cascaded values must be manually reimplemented by copying the dependent rules from _variables.scss — in this case, rewriting $link-color: $purple-000;. Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. Use a custom scheme . To use the custom color scheme, only set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . color_scheme: foo . Switchable custom scheme . If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) with the following content: . --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} .

You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs. You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on GitHub Pages – the template README file explains how to do that, along with other details. If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.2 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. More specifically, the created site: . | uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem | uses the GitHub Pages / Actions workflow to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages | . Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. See the theme README for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site. ",

You can reuse the same parameter values (e.g., integers starting from 1) for the child pages of different parents. The parameter values can be numbers (integers, floats) and/or strings.

If you want to make the page order independent of the page titles, you can set explicit nav_order parameters on all pages. All pages with explicit nav_order parameters come before all pages ordered by their title values. By default, all Capital letters come before all lowercase letters; you can add nav_sort: case_insensitive in the configuration file to ignore the case.

First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) |-- docs |-- ui-components | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- buttons.md | |-- code.md | |-- labels.md | |-- tables.md | +-- typography.md | |-- utilities | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- color.md | |-- layout.md | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | +-- typography.md | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . | has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 --- . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. Ordering child pages . You can optionally add the following to the YAML front matter to reverse the default sort order of child pages: . | child_nav_order: reversed | . Example . --- layout: default title: Reversed Child Pages child_nav_order: reversed --- . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false --- . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. | Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | . Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . --- layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 --- . This would create the following navigation structure: . +-- .. |-- UI Components |-- .. | |-- Buttons | |-- Button Child Page | |-- .. | +-- ..

There may be occasions where you’re using a heading and you don’t want it to show up in the TOC, so to skip a particular heading use the {: .no_toc } CSS class.

The Table of Contents can be made collapsible using the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements , as in the following example. The attribute open (expands the Table of Contents by default) and the styling with {: .text-delta } are optional. &lt;details open markdown=\"block\"&gt; &lt;summary&gt; &lt;/summary&gt; {: .text-delta } 1.
